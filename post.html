                    Cancer is the leading cause of death across the globe. For years now, researchers 
                    have led meticulous studies focused on how to stop this deadly disease in its tracks. 
                    How close are we to finding more effective treatments?

                <h2 class="mgn-top-4 mgn-btm-2">Boosting the immune system’s ‘arsenal’</h2>
                <p class="blog-story">
                    One type of therapy that has attracted a lot of attention recently is <strong>immunotherapy</strong>, which aims to reinforce 
                    our own bodies’ existing arsenal against <u>foreign bodies and harmful</u> cells: our immune system’s response to the
                    spread of cancer tumors.But many types of cancer cell are so dangerous because they have ways of “duping” the 
                    immune system — either into ignoring them altogether or else into giving them a “helping hand.”Therefore, 
                    some types of aggressive cancer are able to spread more easily and become resistant to <i>chemotherapy or radiotherapy</i>.
                    However, thanks to in vitro and in <br><br>A study published last year in Nature Immunology found that macrophages, or white
                    blood cells, that are normally tasked with “eating up” cellular debris and other harmful foreign “objects” failed to obliterate
                    the super-aggressive cancer cells. That was because, <blockquote>in their interaction with the cancer cells, the macrophages read not one 
                    but two signals meant to repel their “cleansing” action.</blockquote> This knowledge, however, also showed the scientists the way forward: by
                    blocking the two relevant signaling pathways, they re-enabled the white blood cells to do their work.
